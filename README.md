# ScortestCommonSuperstring
This is an algorithm that I developed during the second year of university in order to compute the shortest common superstring given a set of strings
The folder contains two scripts each able to calculate the shortest common super string given a set of strings as input.
Each of the two scripts implements a different approach
-"bfa.py" uses a brute force approach
-"scs.py" uses a greedy approach
The input must be a set of strings.
The output is the shortest common super string
All details about the execution of the programs are localised at the beginning of each script as commented lines.
